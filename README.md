# Moody

A simple Processing sketch to use your facial expressions to generate a soundscape in the key of B flat. The sketch uses [Bryan Chung's PSmile library](http://www.magicandlove.com/blog/2011/05/04/smile-detection-in-processing-mac-osx/) for smile detection and [Minim](http://code.compartmental.net/tools/minim/) for audio processing.
